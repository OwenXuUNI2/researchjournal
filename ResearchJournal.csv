left,Facebook,Facial Recognition Book by Lim Si Ping,"Facebook is an interactive book by interacitve artist Lim Si Ping. The book uses facial recognition to pair you with data already present of you on the internet and search engines. This concept of using cameras and facial technology challenges notions of privacy in the digital age. No one's data is truly private and I think it an idea that is very important to add in my second workbook, especially with creative coding. One of my webpages was inspired by this notion, it uses the camera and turns the user's portrait into data showing that in the digital world we lose all sense of personality and instead just become lines of data.",https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/rre0RQ-mYoJYNcxZ7clTXr7NtCLtHIGx0XS3CF9frUA0PJzJtBbVem7YRWsxKlfVYPaBblW66XzLiXMArm3nqqmLI5Kuu3WYH5piqj3i1GsEtbfaOL7t-F-1f7864uH6HEiBw6_YKj5JnDo,,"Lim Si Ping's ""Facebook""",,https://www.designboom.com/art/handson-facebook-interactive-facial-recognition-book-story-01-18-2019/,"Coding, Interaction",
left,Interstellar,Movie directed by Christopher Nolan in 2014,"Interstellar is a 2014 film directed  by Christopher Nolan and follows a group of astronauts tasked to find a new planet for humans as Earth is slowly becoming more and more inhabitable. The main inspiration is the black hole ""Gargantua"" that is featured in the film. The black hole was an vfx and technological marvel as it was one of the most accurate depictions of a black hole at the time and took around 100 days to render. The idea of a single large entity was a very interesting concept that I wanted to add into my second workbook ""Celestial"",  similarly the whole film being depicted in space was also a large help in the formulation of my 3D world, although not as complex as the film I still wanted to capture the overall impression.

It is a helmet designed to hide the user and instead allow them to communicate with the outside world through using headphones, microphones and cameras. The intention was to fuse virtual interaction with physical interaction and challenge the ideas of what is the norm for communication. I was introduced to this helmet in a lecture on physical computing, and it did make me wonder on what reality could look like for the future. For me, I felt it was vital to take a step back and focus on the overall picture to see how technology has developed and how it affected our lives, this idea brought me to thinking about the past and helped develop the inital idea of my workbook ""Retrospekt"".

They were inventions that were far from practical but had humorous applications, it slowly became an movement with people and while it couldn’t be mass produced it was a funny critique on typical norms and became a work of art. When I was first introudced to Chindogu in a lecture I was very drawn in by the creative thought behind creating such inventions, I wanted to make something that shared similar humor but also proved to be useful, Kawakami's art of ""Chindogu"" had served to became a huge inspiration for my final project with physcial computing.",https://cdn.hswstatic.com/gif/chindogu.jpg,https://pen-online.com/fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/22072438/CHINDOGU_2-1024x683.jpg,Chindogu Products,More Chindogu Products,https://www.tofugu.com/japan/chindogu-japanese-inventions/,"Inventions, Chindogu",

Born colour-blind he implemented an antenna in his own head that allowed him to perceive color through vibrations which is then translated into sound-chords. This idea of cybernetics was an interesting avenue I could go down for my physical computing project which is an anti-sleep/procrastination helmet. The idea of keeping minimal was also inspired by Neil's antenna as the invention should be something that should be a large aspect of the person, just a useful tool.",https://djwp.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/12104931/Neil_1.jpg,,Neil Harbisson with his Antenna,,https://metalmagazine.eu/en/post/neil-harbisson-the-reality-of-a-cyborg,"Pysical Computing, Inventions, Cybernetics",
left,Outer Wilds,Game by Annapurna Interactive,"While my first workbook ""Spherical"" dealt with space aspects very vaguely, I had decided I wanted to hone in on the idea of celestial spaces in my second workbook however I was still a bit unsure on the medium. In our p5.js experimentations I had found that 3D was possible to be implemented. This is where the game Outer Wilds came to mind, Outer Wilds is a game developed by Annapurna Interactive in 2019 and follows the protagonist as they navigate a low poly planetary system while being stuck in a 22 minute loop. I would describe the game as a puzzle-solving game and hence was a form of interaction I wanted to add in my workbook, further the idea of a 3d solar system that the user could interact with was also inspired by this game.",https://image.api.playstation.com/vulcan/ap/rnd/202208/1623/Zofebh60Ue7Zt5sC10UAtU3D.png,,"Title Page for ""Outer Wilds"", Seen on disc covers",,https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html,Game,

One thing that really stuck with me was the retro style of the visual components paired with the neon glow which I found really unique and effective. This became a large inspiration for my design choice in my third workbook ""Retrospekt"" which was already following a retro stylistic theme.","https://images.e-flux-systems.com/aa_2015_06_10_VS1967-004-Poemfield-No.-7v3_LB.jpg,1600",,"""Poemfield no7"" by Stan VanDerBeek",,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGoExRRCelc,"Coding, Film",
left,Poly Haven,Website for 3d textures,"Before the start of Workbook One I was already a huge fan of 3D design having worked with Blender for a while, when I settled on the idea of ""Spherical"", I was reminded of the website Polyhaven. Polyhaven is a website I used for 3D to obtain textures and HDRIs for my models and they were all displayed in the form of spheres. This idea of containing information in spheres was something I wanted to add into my workbook ""Spherical"", getting the user to interact with the circles in some way was an intersting componenet. I felt it became a solid starting point for the development of my workbook as it solidified the idea of using circles and spheres as the main theme.",https://blog.polyhaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/featured.jpg,,A pile of textures downloadable from Polyhaven,,https://polyhaven.com,"Website, 3D",

The use of spheres provide an unique interaction with light and it was an aspect that I wanted to work with.

left,The Matrix,Movie directed by Lana Wachowski and Lily Wachowski in 1999,"The Matrix is a science fiction film created in 1999, it was a pioneer in visual effects and cinematography at the time, certainly it has become influential in my work namely due to the infamous digital code rain effects. I was first introduced to this film when were tasked to watch one before the semester had started, to me I was drawn in by the digital visual effects despite the film being made 26 years ago. The overall aesthetic using green programs and black backdrops came back to me when we had just started our physical computing module as I was reminded of retro technology. The film soon became a main inspiration in my 2C workbook ""Retrospekt"" where I wanted to mimic that sort of digital retro feeling that I had felt. Further, in the movie, the digital programs and code symbolized a method of simulation within the Matrix, to me I felt it was quite relevant today with the coming of VR and AR technology where the lines of the physical and virtual worlds are blurred.",https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/dXNAPwY7VrqMAo51EKhhCJfaGb5.jpg,,"Promotional Poster for ""The Matrix"", 1999",,https://medium.com/illumination/what-is-the-matrix-really-979a1b277222,"Films, 1999", 
left,Two Kingdoms,"Wesbite, Created by Pierre Herme and Nicolas Buffe","Two Kingdoms was a website I stumbled upon during an Hunt and Gather exercise in class and it was one that stuck with me throughout every project. The website itself is a visual story full of interaction and visual effects and from the start became a goal that I wanted to achieve. To me storytelling it a huge aspect in my workbook and I wanted to develop that idea. Visually I was drawn in by the fairytale-like design, mainly through the black backdrop pair with white stairs, it is subtle and therefore would draw attention to the main content however still effective in communicating an overall aesthetic. Another component that I had liked was the use of interactive circle in the centre, not only it paired with the stars but it would react based on mouse movement which I thought was really interesting to play with. Overall, this provided a solid framework for my first workbook ""Spherical"".",https://nicolasbuffe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Visuel-Home-page-du-chapitre-1-v10-2k-Roxane.jpg,,"A still from the interactive story ""Two Kingdoms""",,http://www.pierrehermenicolasbuffe.com,"Website, Storytelling",
